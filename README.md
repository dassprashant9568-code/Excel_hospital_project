## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital patient data to identify key factors influencing **readmission rates** and **patient risk levels**.  
The entire analysis was performed in **Microsoft Excel** using **Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Interactive Dashboards**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To provide data-driven insights that help hospitals reduce patient readmissions and improve healthcare outcomes.

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Cleaned raw hospital data using **Power Query**.  
- Removed duplicates and null values.  
- Converted data types (text, numeric, date).  
- Created new calculated columns:
  - `Readmit_Flag` (1 = Readmitted, 0 = Not Readmitted)
  - `Visit_Sum` (total outpatient + inpatient + emergency)
  - `Diagnosis_Group` and `Medication_Group` (for segmentation)

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Examined relationship between **hospital visits, medications, and readmissions**.  
- Identified **high-risk patient segments** based on diagnoses and visit frequency.  
- Used correlation analysis to find **strong predictors** of readmission.  
- Created a **Power Query transformation** to structure medication data (X1–X25).  

---

## 📈 Dashboard
Designed an **interactive Excel dashboard** to visualize:
- Overall readmission rate and patient count  
- Readmission by visit type and diagnosis group  
- Medication impact on readmission  
- High-risk patient segments  

**Dashboard Features:**
- Dynamic slicers for Age, Gender, and Readmit_Flag  
- Clean visual layout with consistent colors and icons  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Patients with multiple diagnoses and frequent emergency visits had higher readmission probability.  
- High medication counts (≥15) correlated with increased readmission risk.  
- Most readmissions occurred among patients with longer hospital stays.
